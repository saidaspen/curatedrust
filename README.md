# Curated Rust
This is a guided walkthrough of the resources that I used to learn Rust. It is being added to incrementally as I myself learn rust over the next couple of weeks and months.

It is still being worked on and not yet complete.

Some of the days, there are extra material. These are marked as *ðŸ‘‘ Extra* and they are for material that is either not free, material that does not add something new
, or stuff that is not really relevant, but which might still be interesting.

## Week 1: Introduction and getting started
This is our introduction to Rust. It will cover a lot of the fundamentals and when this week is behind us, we will already be able to write software. 
During this week we will be watching video and we will be doing a bit of reading.
Some smaller exercises will also pop up during this week so get ready to code!

### Week 1, Day 1: What is Rust? (~ 1 hour)
So. For this first couple of days we will get to know a lot of things about Rust and we will get to travel 
to different parts of Rust. Try to relax. It's important that you **don't try too hard to learn anything**. 
Just sit back and try to enjoy it. Things will become more clear as we go. 

You probably won't understand all of the material for today, and that's totally fine. If you do understand everything, then great, otherwise you will find that it will all be comprehensible in time, we will come back to some of 
this material later on.

* ðŸ“º 1h 3min: Watch [Considering Rust - Jon Gjengset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnT-LUQgc7s)

### Week 1, Day 2: Getting started (~ 1 hour)
Time to get started. Start off by watching a short video on Rust. Then we continue reading through the introduction (section 1) [Introduction - The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch00-00-introduction.html),
this will have you create not one, but two Hello World! apps.
We then do a bit more intro reading by reading pages sections 1 Why Rust? and 2 Type Safety from [Why Rust?](https://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/files/why-rust.pdf).

All done? Great job! ðŸŽ‰ 
If this took you three hours, rather than an hour and a half, don't worry about it. It's not a contest!

### Week 1, Day 5: Taking a step back (~ 1 hour)
Now we are getting into parts of Rust that many find confusion and difficult. Therefore we will spend more time on this. 
We start off by looking at two presentations. I know, sometimes it's hard co stay awake going through these. Check one of them out today, and look at the other tomorrow.

### Week 1, Day 6: Even more video! (~ 40 min)
Bring out the popcorn, another video, just as promised yesterday!
Don't worry if you don't understand every detail in this video. We are heading into a part of rust that many find quite confusion and hard, namely Ownership and Borrowing. These two videos; the one you watched yesterday, and the one you will be watching now, will set you up to better understand the material to come. We will be taking a couple of days to go over this area, as it is quite advanced, but also very fundamental.

## Week 2: It's getting more advanced
Good job! We have not gotten through the first week of Rust. We have learned the basics and also written some code. 
Since last week ended with us watching a bunch of video, we will start this week off by doing some programming.

After the short break of Day 1, we will try to rush ahead a bit. Some of the areas won't make sense until you are through them all. Therefore we want to get through the more advanced subjects of Structs, Enums, Pattern matching, error handling, iterators and collections pretty quickly only to circle back and go over them all again.

### Week 2, Day 1: Nothing new just plain programming (~ 1 hour, 10 min)
No new content today. Instead we will just do a couple of programming exercises to get us more comfortable writing actual code.

* ðŸ’» 30 min: Do as many Project Euler problems that you can fit in 30 minutes.  [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net). Don't worry about how many you actually finish. This is aimed to get us used to writing actual code.
* ðŸ’» 20 min: Do the problem called Matching Brackets on [Exercism](https://exercism.io/)
* ðŸ’» 20 min: Do the problem called Proverb on [Exercism](https://exercism.io/)

#### ðŸ‘‘ Extra
If you have more time keep doing project Euler challenges. Wait a bit with doing more of the Exercism exercises, we will learn some other Rust features, such as pattern matching, enums and structs, that will help you do those challenges later.

### Week 2, Day 2: Structs, methods and strings (~ 1 hour, 20min)
* ðŸ“šðŸ’» 25 min: Read all the sections of [5. Using Structs to Structure Related Data](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch05-00-structs.html) from [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/title-page.html). Follow along by writing the code yourself.
* ðŸ“š 15 min: Read section [8.2. Storing UTF-8 Encoded Text with Strings](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch08-02-strings.html) from [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/title-page.html). Don't worry about the references to *vec*, we will get to it soon.
* ðŸ“š 5 min: Read [3.1 Structures](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/custom_types/structs.html) in [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/index.html)

### Week 2, Day 5: Error Handling (~ 1 hour, 15 min)
Some find Error handling in Rust to be difficult. I should know, I am one of them. Coming from a language like Java or Python, Rust's error handling can seem obscure. I am told, however, that you get used to it and that you learn to love it. 
Let's get started!

* ðŸ“š 25 min: Read [9. Error Handling](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch09-00-error-handling.html) from [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html)

### Week 2, Day 6: Generic Types, Traits and Lifetimes (~ 1 hour, 35min)
Traits are pretty straight forward, so it lifetimes. At least in our first pass of them. We will come back to them later to dig more into the nitty gritty.
You will find that the concepts here are pretty easy to grasp, but beneath the simple facade there lies a much more complex and intricate structure.
Up until this point, what we have learned has been pretty much what we would lean in other languages as well. But once we get into Lifetimes, we are in uncharted territory. 

* ðŸ“š 25 min: Read [10. Generic Types, Traits, and Lifetimes](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch10-00-generics.html) from [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html)
* ðŸ“š 10 min: Read through section Reading Rust from [Why Rust?](https://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/files/why-rust.pdf). This has some material that you will know since before, but it does'nt hurt to repeat it.
* ðŸ“š 20 min: Read [14. Generics from Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/generics.html), it goes a bit deeper.
* ðŸ“š 20 min: Read entire section of [16 Traits](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/traits.html). **Except for** *16.5 Iterators*, we will cover Iterators* next week, and *16.6 impl Trait*, which we will also cover later. Lot's of good examples in this part of the book. Pay special attention to anything related to ```Box``` and ```dyn```.
* ðŸ’» 20 min: Do [Rustlings](https://github.com/fmoko/rustlings) exercises *traits1*, *traits2*, *generics1*, *generics2*, *generics3*

#### Extra
* ðŸ“° 10 min: Read [Rust's Built-in Traits, the When, How & Why](https://llogiq.github.io/2015/07/30/traits.html)
* ðŸ“° 10 min: Read [Rust, Lifetimes, and Collections](http://cglab.ca/~abeinges/blah/rust-lifetimes-and-collections/)
* ðŸ“° 10 min: Read [Rust, Generics, and Collections](http://cglab.ca/~abeinges/blah/rust-generics-and-collections/)

### Week 2, Day 7: More traits and life-times
* ðŸ“š 15 min: Read [15.4 Lifetimes from Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/scope/lifetime.html).
* ðŸ“š 15 min: Read through [Basics A Gentle Introduction to Rust](https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/2-structs-enums-lifetimes.html). You have seen all of this material before, but this is for hammering it into our heads. Enjoy!
* ðŸ“š 20 min: Read through [Strucs, Enums and Matching from A Gentle Introduction to Rust](https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/2-structs-enums-lifetimes.html). Same thing here. No new material, we keep on rehearsing!

#### Extra
* ðŸ’» 40 min: Do [Advent of Code 2018 Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/1), you should know everything you need for this one. It does not teach you anything new about Rust, but it should get you more comfortable writing code. Also, if you struggle, try Googling for help, or turn to Reddit for help. We have not yet covered how to find your way around the Rust documentation, but that is coming very soon!


## Week 3: Half way there
We have passed the half-way point of the foundation. When this week is done, we will have covered all the essentials. From that point on our learning will change somewhat. We will write more code ourselves and the material we are reading will change. We will be going into depth.
But for now, let's hunker down and get through more new material. But first...

### Week 3, Day 1: A breather (~ 1 hour, 30min)
Today we will sit back and watch video again. Bring out the popcorn.
Again, as usual, don't worry too much if you don't understand all the details. Some of the things covered in this video are things we have yet to encounter in our reading.

* ðŸ“º 1h 32min: Watch [Rust Programming Techniques](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqavdUGKeb4). 

### Week 3, Day 1: Iterators and closures

https://hermanradtke.com/2015/06/22/effectively-using-iterators-in-rust.html

### Week 3, Day 2: Itertools
### Week 3, Day 3: Coding!
### Week 3, Day 4: Back to ownership
Today we are going to to a lot of reading. In fact, most pieces of the puzzle is already in place. Today we will be reading blog posts on ownership. It's always good to see others perspectives.

* ðŸ“° 15 min: Read [Lock-freedom without garbage collection](https://aturon.github.io/blog/2015/08/27/epoch/)
* ðŸ“° 10 min: [Where Rust Really shines](https://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/03/where-rust-really-shines/)

* ðŸ“° 5 min: Read [Strategies for solving 'cannot move out of' borrowing errors in Rust](https://hermanradtke.com/2015/06/09/strategies-for-solving-cannot-move-out-of-borrowing-errors-in-rust.html)
* ðŸ“° 5 min: Read [Graphical depiction of ownership and borrowing in Rust](https://rufflewind.com/2017-02-15/rust-move-copy-borrow)

### Week 3, Day 5: 
### Week 3, Day 6: 
### Week 3, Day 7: 

## Week 4
It is time to take a break. No, really.
When I got to this point, I was a bit sick and tired of all the reading. I wanted to build something. If you are feeling the same way, go ahead and do that. You still don't have all the pieces to the puzzle for completing a full-fledged app. But you can get quiet far. Practice makes perfect. 
Take a break. Go build something (and please share it with me when you are done!), and then get back here to continue the journey.
