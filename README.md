# Curated Rust
This is a list of resources that I used to learn Rust. It is being added to incrementally as I myself learn rust over the next couple of months and weeks.

Some of the days, there are extra material. This is for material that is either not free, material that does not add anything new
, or only elaborated on previously covered topics.

## Week 1: Introduction and getting started
This is our introduction to Rust. We will be watching a lot of video and we will be doing a bit of reading.
Some smaller exercises will also pop up during this week.

### Day 1: What is Rust? (~ 1 hour)
So. For this first couple of days we will get to know a lot of things about Rust and we will get to travel 
to different parts of Rust. Try to relax. It's important that you **don't try too hard to learn anything**. 
Just sit back and try to enjoy it. Things will become more clear as we go. 

You probably won't understand all of the material for today, and that's totally fine. If you do understand everything, then great, otherwise you will find that it will all be comperhensible in time, we will come back to some of 
this material later on.

* ðŸ“º 1h 3min: Watch [Considering Rust - Jon Gjengset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnT-LUQgc7s)

### Day 2: Getting started (~ 1 hour)
Time to get started. Start off by watching a short video on Rust. Then we continue reading through the introduction (section 1) [Introduction - The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch00-00-introduction.html),
this will have you create not one, but two Hello World! apps.
We then do a bit more intro reading by reading pages sections 1 Why Rust? and 2 Type Safety from [Why Rust?](https://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/files/why-rust.pdf).

* ðŸ“º 6 min: Watch [Rust and the Future of Systems Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EPsnf_ZYU0)
* ðŸ“š 20 min: Read through [Introduction - The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch00-00-introduction.html)

* ðŸ“š 15 min: Checkout the Hello World example of [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/hello.html). Read 1.1 Comments but skip section 1.2 Formatted Print for now.

### Day 3: Variables (~ 1 hour 10 minutes)
Now we are actually about to write our first pieces of software. Let's get into it!

* ðŸ“š 25 min: Read [2. Programming a Guessing Game](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html) from [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/title-page.html)
* ðŸ“š 10 min: While we are talking about random stuff anyway, head over to Rust Cookbook and read [Generate random numbers](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/algorithms/randomness.html#generate-random-numbers). Try to understand the code, but don't spend too much time digging into the details.
* ðŸ“š 7 min: Read [3.1 Variables and Mutability](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html) from [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/title-page.html)
* ðŸ’» 10 min: Setup [Rustlings](https://github.com/fmoko/rustlings).
* ðŸ’» 15 min: Do exercises *variables1*, through *variables6* from the [Rustlings](https://github.com/fmoko/rustlings) Course
* ðŸ“š 2 min: Read about [constants](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/custom_types/constants.html) in the [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example)

### Day 4: Types, Functions and flow control (~ 1 hour 30 minutes)
* ðŸ“š 8 min: Read [3.2 Data Types](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch03-02-data-types.html) from [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/title-page.html)
* ðŸ’» 5 min: Read all the sections of [2. Primitives](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/primitives.html) from [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/primitives.html), skip the activity for section '2.2 Tuples' for now, we will get back to it.
* ðŸ“š 8 min: Read [3.3 Functions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch03-03-how-functions-work.html) from [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/title-page.html)
* ðŸ“š 1 min: Read [7. Expressions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/expression.html) in the [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/primitives.html)

Do not do the exercises at the very end, we will do them in a minute, but first read about control flow also in Rust By Example.
* ðŸ’» 10 min: Read sections [8.1 if/else] (https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/flow_control/if_else.html) through [8.4 for and range](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/flow_control/for.html) of [Rust By Example]. Go ahead and write up your own version of FizzBuzz!
* Go back to to [the Summary of 3.5 Control Flow](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch03-05-control-flow.html#summary) and implement those three small programs:
  - ðŸ’» 5 min: Convert temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius

### Day 5: Functions
### Day 6: Control Flow
### Day 7: Type to put it all together
